Now, when we bring in the third row entries, we need to check in which cluster does it belong, for that purpose we will be using our K1 which is our first point and K2 which is our second point and find the euclidean distance between them and the new point.

For that we have something called the elbow method which helps us in selecting the optimal number of clusters. The idea is very simple. We need to calculate the sum of squared errors or SSE for each value of K in a given range. We will then plot a graph. It should look like an arm and the point where there is sudden dip in the plot or an 'elbow' is present, we take that K value to be the optimal K value. As we increase K value, the SSE tends to 0. So the goal is to choose a small value of K which also gives us a small SSE.
